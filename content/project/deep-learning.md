## Developing Linear Regression Model 

Linear regression model offers simple and fundamental modeling approach for any kind of data. This projects develops a python class for regression model. Modeling enthusiast can input data into
this class and can input data to this class and get a fitted  model for the data you input. You can also specify the order of the fitting equation. 

## Before You Start

I know you are super excited to test your data to get a model, but before that how about you get stuffs ready to have a smooth model creation process. Things You need are:

- Basic knowledge on Statistics
- Coding  experience in scripting language like python, r 
- Object oriented programming
